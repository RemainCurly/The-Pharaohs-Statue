# The Pharaoh's Statue
 
### NOTE: This project requires at least Java 11, JOGL, and JOML as PATH variables in order to be compiled and ran. You also need to be using a GPU that supports OpenGL.

This is a project I made individually for my Csc 155 (Advanced Graphics) course using Java OpenGL.  

The 3D scene displays many OpenGL features such as camera control, bump mapping, object imports, and lighting & shadows. Further details about the graphical features can be found in the "Assignment 4 Report" PDF file.

## Instructions

Simply run the compile.bat file, and then the run.bat file. A window should open up, which will shortly load the OpenGL scene. Instructions on navigating & interacting with the scene can be found on page 3 of the "Assignment 4 Report" PDF file.

Anubis/Scarab beetle).
